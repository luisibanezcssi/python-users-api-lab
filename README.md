# Users API Intro

This code illustrates how to use the Users API for authentication.


## Launch

To run this code launch `dev_appserver.py` as

```
dev_appserver.py [path_to_app_name]
```

If you are in the directory with all of your App Engine code then `[path_to_app_name]` can be replaced with a `.` (period).

To view the app:
```
localhost:8080
```

To view the app backend:
```
localhost:8000
```

## Goals

+ You are encouraged to run the code and tinker with the different elements
